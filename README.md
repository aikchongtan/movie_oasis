# Movie Oasis

This web application is one of a series built in satisfaction of course requirements for General Assembly, Software Engineering Immersion course, batch #19, Singapore.  

In this project, I built an online movie sales site with Express Node.js, React.js, HTML5, bootstrap CSS, and Postgres database.  You may enjoy the application at this address: https://movieoasis.herokuapp.com

This app makes API calls to a movie database site in USA to retrieve movie posters and details.  I am able to demonstrate my mastery in making asynchronous API calls to query, save to database, analyze and display the following information:

1.  Movies by genres;
2.  Ranking movies by sales;
3.  Saved movie lists by registered users;
4.  A recommender system to recommend next-movies to watch for registered users.

An associative rule recommender model is implemented to overcome the cold-start issue faced by this newly set up site.  The model is created using Python programming language since I am unfamiliar with Javascript machine learning ecosystems.

Overall, I am proud of this site because users are able to navigate smoothly through their purhcase journeys, and the visuals are able to render smoothly while asynchronous API calls are made.

In future iteration, I can consider adding the following features:

1.  Sentiment analysis of viewers' sentiments about screened movies, to gain insights regarding movies sales;
2.  Dashboard to analyse site user interaction, sales performance etc;
3.  More advanced recommender algorithms i.e., collaborative item filtering, K-nearest neighbor etc, to give more personalized suggestions;
4.  A conversational chatbot to respond to registered users' queries etc ...

If I wish to revamp the site in future to handle more visitors and enhance their UX, I may consider implementing it with Django + React.js. to serve bigger scale traffic.

Any suggestion to enhance the site is welcome :) Do let me know.
