# Movie Oasis

This web application is one of a series built in satisfaction of course requirements for General Assembly, Software Engineering Immersion course, batch #19, Singapore.  

In this project, I built an online movie sales site with Express.js, React.js, HTML5, bootstrap CSS, and Postgres database.  This app makes API calls to a movie database site in USA to retrieve movie posters and details.  I am able to demonstrate my mastery in making asynchronous API calls to catalog, save to database, analyze and display the following information:

1.  Movies by genres;
2.  Ranking movies by sales;
3.  Saved movie lists by registered users; and
4   A recommender system to recommend next-movies to watch for registered users.

An associative rule recommender model is implemented with Python programming language to overcome the cold-start issue faced by this newly set up sites.

Overall, I am proud of this site because users are able to navigate smoothly through their purhcase journeys, and the visuals are able to render smoothly while asynchronous API calls are made.

In future iteration, I can consider adding the following features:

1.  Sentiment analysis of viewers' sentiment about screened movies;
2.  Dashboard to analyse site user interaction, sales etc;
3.  More advanced recommender algorithms i.e., collaborative item filtering, K-nearest neighbor etc.
4.  A conversational chatbot to serve registered users etc ...

If I wish to revamp the site in future to handle more visitors and enhance their UX, I may consider implementing with Django + React.js.
