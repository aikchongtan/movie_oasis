# Movie Oasis

This is one of a series of app built in satisfaction of course requirements for General Assembly, Software Engineering Immersion course, batch #19.  

In this project, I implemented Express.js, HTML5, bootstrap CSS to build a an online movie sales site.  This app makes API calls to a movie database site in USA to display movie posters and details.
Hence, I am able to demonstrate my mastery in making asynchronous API routing calls to catalog, save to database, and display the following information:

1.  Movies by genres;
2.  Ranking movies by sales; and
3.  Saved movie lists by registered users.

In addition, a recommender system is implemented to recommend movies to registered users.  Since this app is an MVP, and I do not have sufficient to create enough synthetic data, an associative rule recommender model is implemented to overcome the cold-start issue faced by newly set up sites.

This app has room for extensibility of features.  In future iteration, I can consider adding the following features:

1.  Sentiment analysis of movies;
2.  Dashboard to analyse site user interaction;
3.  More advanced recommender systems i.e., collaborative item filtering, K-nearest neighbor etc.
